## [Installation (NPM)](#install-npm)

The project is divided in three different part that could need some dependances:
- Client

    The client should be repacked with anything `webpack` like.
- Server

    The server part is an implementation of `fastify`, `node`, `node-html-parser` and `ws`.
    There's also subpart for the server, like the database communication.
- Portable

    It doesn't need any dependances, it can be used on either a webpage or a server.
