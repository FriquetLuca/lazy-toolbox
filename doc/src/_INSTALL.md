## [Installation (NPM)](#install-npm)

The project is divided in three different part that could need some dependances:
- Client

    The client part need to be repack with something like `webpack`.
- Server

    The server dependances are `fastify`, `ws` and `node`.
- Portable

    The portable part don't need any dependances since it's gonna be either used by the client or the server.
