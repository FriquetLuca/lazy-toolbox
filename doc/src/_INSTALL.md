## [Installation (NPM)](#install-npm)

The project is divided in three different part that could need some dependances:
- Client

    The client part need to be repack with something like `webpack`.
- Server

    The server dependances are `fastify`, `ws` and `node`.
- Portable

    It doesn't need any dependances, it can be used on either a webpage or a server.
