# Lazy Toolbox

> A NodeJS toolbox made for a lazy development of websites or even applications.

The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/FriquetLuca/lazy-toolbox).

Lazy Toolbox is made of multiples parts, you can find the sources of those parts over here:
- [Server](https://github.com/FriquetLuca/lazy-toolbox/tree/master/lazy-server)
    - [MySQL](https://github.com/FriquetLuca/lazy-toolbox/tree/master/lazy-mysql)
- [Client](https://github.com/FriquetLuca/lazy-toolbox/tree/master/lazy-client)
- [Portable](https://github.com/FriquetLuca/lazy-toolbox/tree/master/lazy-portable)

**Note**: You should note that this package is subject to changes, sometimes even subject to repacking. It's made alongside another project, so some features are potentially not ideal as of right now. Lazy Toolbox should be safe from any savage repacking when version 2 will come out.
